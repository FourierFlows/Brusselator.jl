# Brusselator.jl/examples

These are some basic examples of the various modules included in Brusselator.jl. 

## Run the examples

Alternatively, you can run these scripts directly. While inside the `examples` folder do
```julia
] instantiate
```
to install dependencies. Then run any of the examples by
```julia
include("example_script.jl")
```
